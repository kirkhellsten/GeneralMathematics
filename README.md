# Permutations And Combinations

Computing factorial

Two concepts explored to compute the factorial of some positive number N is iteration and recursion. Three iterations used was for, do, and while loops; along with head and tail recursions. All function inputs are unsigned int, the return values is unsigned int. Reason unsigned int is used since computation is only positive numbers. The return type can be 0 but is never used. The range of numbers for return type is 1 to theoretically positive infinity, whatever max limit positive number the language and compiler can handle. Coded in C++ with CodeBlocks, saved as Console Project. The main function is called and all coded factorial functions are called, factorial of 10 is printed to console for all functions.

Project Name

The name has been changed to Permutations And Combinations. The reason is factorials are commonly used in Permutations and Combinations, a branch of mathematics studied under probability. ipracticemath.com [0] is consider a good source of what branch of mathematics factorial lies in. Originally put under General Mathematics since the formal conception was it was not under any branch of mathematics and needed to be put under some heading. Factorials is said to be primarily used in the branch Permutations and Combinations, however it is still used in other branches of mathematics. This very little use in other branches, as well as the known primary branch, were the factors in the decision to change the project name.
